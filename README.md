A repository filled with codewars challenges (kata). Completed over 100+ challenges - currently pushing 7 solutions every week.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript"/>

Every morning I start my day off by solving a codewars problem! 

## Optimizations

I consistently refactor and optimize my code, to improve readibility and efficiency. 

## Lessons Learned:

The greatest lesson I have learned in tackling this endless supply challenges is that there's always another way to go about a problem. Although one line solutions are pretty, they don't always form the most human readable code. Trying new and different methods can be fun.
